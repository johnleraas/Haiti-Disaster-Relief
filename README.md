# Haiti-Disaster-Relief



This project was done as part of a class on machine learning and used actual satellite data on Haiti following the earthquake in 2010. 

The primary learning outcomes were (i) gaining familiarity with and hyperparameter tuning of different ML models, (ii) comparison of different models and understanding model capacity, and (iii) thinking through the objective function in detail. Notably, very little instruction was provided and certain assumptions and considerations are discussed below.
